Description: This package implements the Stochastic EM approach to Record Linkage described in our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06835 'A flexible model for Record Linkage'. It is a record linkage method, for finding the common set of records among 2 data sources based on Partically Identifying Variables (PIVs) available in both sources. It includes modelling of dynamic PIVs (e.g. zipcode) that may evolve over time. Low memory footprint.
